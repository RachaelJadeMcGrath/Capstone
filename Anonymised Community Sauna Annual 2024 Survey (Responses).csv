At the moment it feels unsafe to leave belongings and there’s not enough lockers to go around especially if they’re being used for shoes and big coats. Be great to have a specific area for hanging coats and shoes to help with this. If there were secure lockers could feel safe bringing my work laptop after work, but right now I don’t do this.

The biggest issue is that there’s no private hot showers and means we can’t properly get clean. This is fine when there is time to travel home to wash. But it does stop me coming to the sauna a lot more often, as I’m unable to fit it in around my day. I cant say, pop in, have a proper wash, and then carry on with my day, I have to go home. 

Apart from that, it’s absolutely amazing.

On another occasion I was asking after my friend's family, when a fellow sauna-user interjected with ""i'd really love it if you'd kill the work chat"" - which was bizarre, especially as a little later, they tried to spark a conversation about the weather.
I understand some people may find silent saunas more comfortable, in which case perhaps it's best to designate certain hours as ""silent sessions"" (and set expectation of exactly what silence means!) - it's a thorny issue, but in my experience of saunas in many places, including Moscow & Copenhagen, they're social spaces providing a shared experience, creating a community, and conversation is natural",,,No,,"I love saunas, I love inviting friends to join me and socialising in an environment which makes me feel good.

I don't know how often you clean the saunas but they seem clean all of the times.
Perhaps to add a scent, like when you use TEA water, and put that on the stove, it gives a nice calming smell to the sauna, 

as you dont really put scents besides when people ask for ice and scent, could be nice to have tea water put on the stove before new sessions or somethign, or in between, when there is break for cleaning and so on

I found the Bermondsey sauna this last visit really disappointing and very difficult to relax - it was a very busy session and the number of people talking very loudly inside the sauna was very off putting. Perhaps more notices like at Glengall about noise and general reminders mindfulness /sauna etiquette would be helpful.

It’s a real treat to look forward to during the week, helping to boost my mood in advance, during and afterwards, feeling much more in sync with myself and others. 

It’s a positive environment I so look forward to, and cherish and hope it will stick around for a long long time. 

The open setting in the community garden at halal is so very special, wandering through the plants, saying hi to the chickens, watching the sun go down, it’s a real oasis away from demanding city life.

I think a hot shower for after saunering would make a big difference as then you could feel really clean afterwards and go out to your day.

Long-time customers already have stomached the increasing unavailability and prices due to the Community's newfound popularity and that's fine as it's part of growing your services, I would just advocate being proactive in making sure you do right by the customer as you grow and make changes to the business, and to remember at your core is an affordable community experience (don't go all corporate on us please).

Similar thing happens at places like West Reservoir. ","1. For the Camden area, consider approaching HS2 and Camden Council about ‘meanwhile use’ opportunities. There is lots of land acquired there for construction which will not be used for years while the project is delayed. Some areas around there are already being used for various pop up spaces, community gardens etc. might be worth having a conversation. 2. When West Reservoir (Stoke Newington) did their consultation on the forthcoming renovations, the top thing respondents asked for was a Sauna. I’m not sure if they have any plan to introduce one, but it might be worth seeing what the art of the possible is there given there is quite a bit of land and serious demand for it. 3.Haggerston - Hoxton Docks, big warehouse thing mostly seems empty, does a lot of pop up things and an annual architecture thing on its roof. Wonder if they might have something 4.Haggerston Park, the Goldsmiths row side near the farm seems to have lots of little businesses opening in temporary type structures and a bit of land and community gardens around, it always seems to be changing and getting a it bigger so maybe opportunity there too. ","At the Hackney Wick location it would be nice if there was a bathroom to go to without walking through the building.

It came quite out of the blue and there was limited communication about it, confusing/conflicting information depending on where you looked on the website and it was timed really badly over Christmas. The costs also fluctuated for the gift packages meaning they were temporarily higher at one point - my partner bought a package of 10x sessions for £120 then the price had gone back down to £110 when I bought a couple of weeks later. It was also really complicated to book and redeem using gift cards. It was unusually lacking in transparency and what I can now see were errors and teething issues looked like sneak price increases. There has again been no communications about any of these issues or that they are now resolved. Given the first recent change to the booking system I was surprised to see another change so quickly and you need to give some reassurance that you’re making sustainable choices rather than revising providers every 6 months.

I was recently in a sauna with another woman who asked a man to speak with a lower volume (very politely) and he was so rude back to here- just not the energy or vibe I""ve come to expect there. Feels like this sort of thing is getting more and more common now the sauna is more popular. It's great that more people are coming, but often feels like they are coming in a group to take instagram pictures and have a social catch up with their mates- talking really loudly and not thinking about anyone else but themselves. 

It would be great if the sauna could make a bigger point of educating people about the etiquette of the sauna- I don't think people (especially not the ones I'm talking about!) read any of the signs around the saunas. The staff never ask anyone to lower their voices at all, which I have seen happen at other saunas. I know it's a difficult task but it would make the experience so much nicer for those of us who come to relax and improve our mental health. It's really hard to do this when someone is bellowing at the top of their voice about a big night out they just had! 

There's a few staff who are super nice and really seem to 'get' the sauna vibes- they're really diligent about keeping the fires topped up and taking the temparatues, but unfortunately some who just don't seem to care :( I run a business so I know how hard it can be to find the right people, so not a massive criticism, but just honest feedback.

I'm not sure if there's a fairer way to make it less booked up than raise the prices? A tough problem to solve! I live so close to the Bermondsey sauna but never book anymore. I'd rather saunter down casually for a session than ""PLAN A FUN UNIQUE LONDON ACTIVITY AT LEAST A WEEK IN ADVANCE BECAUSE LONDON IS THE PLACE TO BE MAKE SURE YOU PUT IT IN YOUR CALENDAR"" etc etc.

I think having more food and drink would be nice, I'm sure people would be happy to pay. I think the occasional clothing optional session would be a good thing in a nod to north European culture, I know it's hard to get that going in the UK because non-sexual nudity is so hard for us to grasp.

There can be a lot of screaming and boasting in the ice baths in particular - I didn't used to be a problem when the sauna first opened, but I've come across people like this more and more often at the sauna, and myself and a few women in a sauna commented on it at one point, just amongst ourselves, because it felt pretty unrelaxing and not part of the sauna community and energy that we want to create! It makes women in particular feel uncomfortable and it really changes the sauna experience if you happen to book a session with groups like this sharing the space - not that any man has ever been personally rude or uncomfortable, but it can make some women feel more looked at, more self-conscious and importantly, this environment is in no way a relaxing space for women to be around. I know that policing or restricting people who use the sauna is not the answer and that there are women only sessions - but the women only sessions (at hackney wick) only have access to one sauna, which feels unfair.
